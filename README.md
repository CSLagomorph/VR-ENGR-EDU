# VR-ENGR-EDU
VR ENGR Education project 

VR Engineering Education is an application that replaces the need for buying and storing physical models by replicating said models within the virtual space. The application is tailored for engineering students, with the hope that by interacting with physics concepts and simulations, there would be an improvement in students' problems solving skills and understanding of physics in 3D space.
